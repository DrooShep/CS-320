How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional I can perform unit tests on it to see if there are any errors within my code. I can also test for coverage of my code to make sure that the code is being seen and functions together the way that it should be. I would make sure that my code coverage has at least an 80% coverage rate.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs I would put myself in their shoes and think what I would want the program to do if I were the one using it.

How do I approach designing software?

When I begin coding I want my code to be easy to read and easy to maintain for future updates so writing in clear consice code is the goal. I want it easy for anyone else to be able to understand what the code is doing so they can also maintain it if I am not around.
